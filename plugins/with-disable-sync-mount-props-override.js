/**
 * Disable React Native 0.86's Android feature flag
 * `overrideBySynchronousMountPropsAtMountingAndroid` (which DEFAULTS TO TRUE).
 *
 * When on, `SurfaceMountingManager.updateProps` merges direct-manipulation
 * "synchronous mount props" (how Reanimated / Native Animated push `transform`
 * and `opacity` under Fabric) onto React's incoming props and `assert()`s that
 * the incoming `transform` is an Array and `opacity` is a Number. A Reanimated-
 * animated view whose props arrive with a mismatched type mid-mount trips that
 * assert → `java.lang.AssertionError: Assertion failed` in
 * `SurfaceMountingManager.overridePropsReadableMap`, killing the app.
 *
 * REPRODUCED 2026-08-20 with this plugin removed: play a track, let it finish, and
 * the app dies on the transition to the next one — the now-playing indicator
 * (`transform: scaleY`, Reanimated) unmounts from the finished row and mounts on the
 * new one while React commits props to it. The opacity banners are the same hazard.
 * This is RN's merge asserting, not bad types on our side: the animated style passes
 * `transform` as a proper array. Fixing one component would leave every other
 * Reanimated transform/opacity animation in the app exposed, which is why this is a
 * global flag override rather than a component change.
 *
 * We can't patch RN source (it ships prebuilt here → source patches are inert),
 * but a runtime feature-flag override works on the prebuilt binary.
 *
 * WHERE it goes is load-bearing, and the two obvious placements are both wrong —
 * both were tried, both crashed on launch:
 *
 *   - Before `super.onCreate()`: `ReactNativeFeatureFlags.override` reaches native
 *     (`ReactNativeFeatureFlagsCxxInterop.<clinit>` → `SoLoader.loadLibrary`), and RN has
 *     not initialised SoLoader yet → `IllegalStateException: SoLoader.init() not yet called`.
 *   - Anywhere before `loadReactNative()`: that call runs
 *     `DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint.load()`, which overrides the flags ITSELF. A second
 *     override then dies with `RuntimeException: Feature flags cannot be overridden more
 *     than once`.
 *
 * So it goes AFTER `loadReactNative()`, using `dangerouslyForceOverride` — the API RN
 * provides for exactly this, replacing an override that is already in place. The provider
 * extends `ReactNativeNewArchitectureFeatureFlagsDefaults` (the same base RN's entry point
 * uses) so the new-architecture flags it just set are preserved rather than reset to
 * library defaults; only our one flag differs. This is still well before anything reads
 * the flag, which happens at mount time once an Activity creates a surface.
 *
 * Trade-off: we lose a minor anti-flicker optimisation (an animated view could
 * briefly show its pre-animation value when a React commit lands mid-animation)
 * in exchange for not crashing. Revisit if a later RN fixes the assert.
